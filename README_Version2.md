# Karim Portfolio

A personalized engineering portfolio showcasing systems programming, IoT innovation, sustainable water management concepts, and data-structure driven application design.

## Bio

I’m Karim, a Software Engineer driven by curiosity and creativity. I’ve built underwater robots, smart IoT devices, and AI-powered systems, and collaborated with major international organizations on cutting-edge technology projects. I believe engineering is the fusion of imagination, precision, and purpose.

## Projects

- **Task Management Application** – Java + stacks & queues for undoable actions, reordering, categories, and statistics.
- **Kernel Experiments** – Exploratory Linux kernel modules and userspace tooling for memory & security mechanisms.
- **Smart Mirror System** – ESP32 + Raspberry Pi real-time interactive mirror (weather, time, calendar, ambient sensing). _Second Place – University Innovation Challenge._
- **Underground Water Management & Recycling System** – Sustainable design concept for capturing, filtering, and reusing agricultural irrigation water with proposed IoT monitoring.
